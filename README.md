🔍 AI-Powered Bug Detection and Code Optimization

An intelligent system that leverages Machine Learning and Static Code Analysis techniques to automatically detect bugs, code smells, vulnerabilities, and performance inefficiencies in source code. The system not only identifies issues but also suggests optimized and improved versions of the code.

🚀 Key Features

🤖 AI-based bug detection using trained ML models

🔎 Static code analysis for syntax & logical errors

⚡ Performance optimization suggestions

🛡️ Security vulnerability detection

📊 Code quality scoring

🧠 Smart refactoring recommendations

🌐 Multi-language support (e.g., Python, Java, C++)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Machine Learning (e.g., Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch)

NLP techniques for code analysis

AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parsing

Git integration

REST API (optional)

Web framework (Flask / Django / FastAPI)

🧠 How It Works

The user uploads source code or connects a Git repository.

The system parses the code using AST and static analysis tools.

The ML model analyzes patterns associated with common bugs.

The system generates:

Detected issues

Severity level

Suggested fixes

Optimized code snippets

📈 Use Cases

Assisting developers during development

Automated code review

CI/CD pipeline integration

Educational tool for beginners

🎯 Future Enhancements

Deep learning-based vulnerability detection

IDE plugin integration

Real-time bug detection

Support for more programming languages🔍 AI-Powered Bug Detection and Code Optimization
